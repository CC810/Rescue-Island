# Rescue-Island
My first python program

This was my first program I have written in Python (learned from the book "Learn Python3 the hard way" from Z. A. Shaw"). 
The .py file consists of a roleplay. Once started, you need to take actions/decisions by answering some questions, 
which will lead you to different path. I include some randomness into the game too. 
The goal of the game is to survive and be rescued. 

The game is quite short but it was more of a python exercise than a goal of getting a full game.

Have fun and that the best survive.
